## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate studying in the Schimel Lab at UC Santa Barbara. My research focuses on understanding controls on soil organic carbon cycling and storage, from both a fundamental and applied perspective. This ranges from theoretical models that seek to describe the effects of organic 'chemodiversity' on soil carbon cycling, to empirical studies that seek to understand how grazing management and organic amendments affect soil carbon storage. I believe that developing a stronger understanding of the mechanisms that drive land management effects on soil function will help create a more sustainable future for our society and planet.


Before graduate school, I spent several years working in seasonal biologist jobs for a variety of public and private organizations, including Point Blue Conservation Science, the National Park Service, and the Audubon Society. My interest in science-backed conservation was shaped by my experience in these jobs. I believe in science that partners with ecosystem managers and policymakers to address critical threats to ecosystems and the climate.
