    "text": "I am a Ph.D. candidate studying in the Schimel Lab at UC Santa Barbara. My research focuses on understanding controls on soil organic carbon cycling and storage, from both a fundamental and applied perspective. This ranges from theoretical models that seek to describe the effects of organic ‘chemodiversity’ on soil carbon cycling, to empirical studies that seek to understand how grazing management and organic amendments affect soil carbon storage. I believe that developing a stronger understanding of the mechanisms that drive land management effects on soil function will help create a more sustainable future for our society and planet.\nBefore graduate school, I spent several years working in seasonal biologist jobs for a variety of public and private organizations, including Point Blue Conservation Science, the National Park Service, and the Audubon Society. My interest in science-backed conservation was shaped by my experience in these jobs. I believe in science that partners with ecosystem managers and policymakers to address critical threats to ecosystems and the climate."

    "text": "Typically, soil C models divide organic C into pools with different decomposition rates, even though these pools contain complex mixtures of organic molecules. This may be important because soil microbes do not decompose pools of SOC. Instead, they take up and metabolize organic molecules with distinct chemical structures. To investigate the possible consequences of this chemical complexity, I developed a mathematical model that represents decomposition of any number of distinct substrates, corresponding enzymes, and the costs and benefits associated with building enzymes. Microbes, when faced with diverse potential substrates, must choose between assimilating one substrate or dividing efforts among many substrates. Either choice has a cost, and with this model, we suggest that this could cause soil organic C pools with higher diversity of organic molecules to decompose more slowly."

    "text": "Developing strategies to store organic C on rangelands is important for both productivity and climate change mitigation. Improved grazing management is one potential strategy for building soil carbon, but this likely depends on how it affects root growth and death. Changes in grazing management can cause changes in root growth, but the nature and magnitude of these changes can vary depending on the plant species being grazed. In this research, I seek to understand how roots of different plant species respond to aboveground grazing, and how these different root responses drive changes in soil carbon cycling. I am particularly interested in investigating the idea that functional traits of plants broadly correspond to root responses, and that the functional composition of plant communities could therefore help predict soil responses to grazing."
