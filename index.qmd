## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Schimel Lab at UC Santa Barbara. My research focuses on understanding controls on soil organic carbon cycling and storage, from both a fundamental and applied perspective. This ranges from theoretical models that seek to describe the effects of organic 'chemodiversity' on soil carbon cycling, to empirical studies that seek to understand how grazing management and organic amendments affect soil carbon storage.

Before graduate school, I spent several years working seasonal land-management jobs for a variety of public and private organizations, including Point Blue Conservation Science, the National Park Service, and the Audubon Society. My interest in science-backed conservation was shaped by my experience in these jobs. Ecosystem managers and policymakers badly need science that can predict the outcomes of management decisions. I seek to address this need both by collecting data and publishing in scientific journals, but also by developing public-facing, accessible communication that describes applications to land management and that seeks feedback from land managers. I believe that developing a stronger understanding of the mechanisms that drive land management effects on soil function will help create a more sustainable future for our society and planet.
